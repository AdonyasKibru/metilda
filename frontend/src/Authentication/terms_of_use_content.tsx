         ARBITRATION NOTICE: UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE "ARBITRATION" SECTION BELOW, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE "ARBITRATION" SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND MeTILDA WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

         General. You and MeTILDA agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration; except that either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court. Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Disputes if you provide MeTILDA with written notice of your desire to do so within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms of Use (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-out Notice"). If you do not provide MeTILDA with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth with respect to individual actions in small claims courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and MeTILDA are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and MeTILDA otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Legal Disputes" section will be deemed void. This "Legal Disputes" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.

         Any legal problems that may arise between you and us must be resolved by you and us through discussion without the involvement of a legal court. We both reserve the right to bring lawsuits to small claims court. You (the user) also have the right to opt out of discussion with us to settle disputes, if you provide written notice to us within 30 days of agreeing to these terms of use. If you do not provide written notice you agree that you have waived the right to litigate, except to bring a suit to small claims court. Further, you agree that you are waiving your right to participate in a class action lawsuit. This paragraph is still legally binding even if you later decide you donâ€™t agree to the terms of use, or stop using MeTILDA.
