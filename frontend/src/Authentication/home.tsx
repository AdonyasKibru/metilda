          is a Learning and Analysis Platform that helps people who are <b/>
          interested to learn the endangered language called <b>Blackfoot</b> and <b/>
          also the linguistic researchers who are working <b/>
          for the protection of the language. The visual representation would <b/>
          allow Blackfoot teachers and learners to understand how their <b/>
          pronunciation compares to that of native speakers. Additionally, it <b/>
          would help linguistics researchers in their efforts to document and <b/>
          transcribe audio clips of endangered languages. <b/>

            Platform for Endangered Language Documentation and Analysis
            (PELDA)
          </b>{" "}
          facilitates the use of linguistic tools called <b>Praat</b> and <b>ELAN</b> <b/>
          by integrating these tools into the application interface. The PELDA interface
          allows users to process endangered language recordings and extract their audio <b/>
          features to facilitate effective language documentation and analysis. It also allows users <b/>
          to select a specific time range of an audio file, add hierarchical tiers, and add <b/>
          annotation (comments/notations) details based on specific requirements. In addition, <b/>
          all annotation-related information can be saved in an XML file on the system and <b/>
          viewed later for future access. <b/>
